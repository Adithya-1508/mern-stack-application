stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Inspired by the popular social
media platforms, SnapGram aims to provide users with a seamless and
engaging experience for sharing photos, connecting with friends, and
discovering new content. Key Features:

application offers features for editing profiles, including bio, username, and other relevant details. 3. Photo Sharing and Viewing: SnapGram enables users to upload and

posted by people they follow, like and comment on photos, and discover
trending content through personalized recommendations. 4. Real-time Notifications: The application provides real-time notifications
to users for activities such as likes, comments, and new followers. Users
receive instant alerts to stay updated on interactions with their content
and connections. 5. Search and Discovery: SnapGram includes powerful search and
discovery features, allowing users to find friends, explore trending
content, and discover new users to follow. The application employs
advanced algorithms to personalize the content discovery experience
based on user preferences and interactions. 6. Responsive Design: SnapGram is designed to be responsive and
accessible across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and
smartphones. The user interface adapts seamlessly to different screen
sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience for all users.
